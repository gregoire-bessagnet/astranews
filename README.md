*Astranews - Switcher* is our last app and main project worked and pitched at [Le Wagon Bordeaux devcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/fr/bordeaux). Entirely based in Rails, we're proude to introduce you to it.


Built as a blogging plateform with a great Markdown editor, its aim is to evolve to a bigger publication app.
You can fork the project and feel free to contact us/me here, by forking and pulling requests or via Twitter : @mygreg.
